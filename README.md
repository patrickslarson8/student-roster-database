## Data Location

For this project hosted on GitHub, the tables are all local to the application. This does not allow more than one person to work with the database at once. It is recommended to split the database so that multiple people can work on the tables at once. An easy way to do this is to create a sharepoint site and select "Database Tools" -> "SharePoint"

## Known Limitations

- This database is not-normalized (completely flat). This is because we needed to import data from a flat excel file.
